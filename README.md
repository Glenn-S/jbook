# JBook

A local code markup editor built using React and ExpressJS.

This is a project built following the course [React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/) by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).

## TODO

Update the output file to format and parse a more readible js file where the text blocks are formatted as comments.
